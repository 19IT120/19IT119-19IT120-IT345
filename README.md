Number plate recognition using machine learning

**Project Overview**
It is number plate recognition using Machine Learning . In this System we will recognize the number plate of vehicle. The number plate recognition is an image processing technique to extract the image of license plate on vehicle taken by digital camera or taken by either a colour or a grayscale digital camera, as well as an infrared camera in order to identify the vehicles using their number plate. It consists of a camera to detect the number plate object and processing unit to process and extract the characters and interpret the pixels into numerically readable characters

**Implementation strategy**
During the last few years, the development of machine learning algorithms has gained progress in many aspects. Nowadays, with the increasing number of vehicles, number plate scanning using machine learning algorithms like K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN) will be useful as manual efforts of humans will decrease along with the error rates . Initially, the camera will be used to capture the image. Once the image is captured, the algorithm will process it by converting it into grayscale, followed by extracting the possible number plates and finally recognizing the registration number of the vehicle. The final registration details will be searched from the database and will be displayed on the screen
